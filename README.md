## Genshin Impact Team Randomizer

> A web app to randomize your Genshin Impact team based on the characters that you own

## Usage

Click on the character icons to select / remove them from the pool of selectable options.  
The selection is stored locally so you don't need to re-enter all your characters on subsequent visits.

Once your roster is set, hit the "Generate teams" button.
